# Overview

As a software engineer striving to deepen my understanding of Java, I developed a simple number guessing game. This project not only demonstrates my growing proficiency with the Java language but also showcases key programming concepts such as abstraction, inheritance, file handling, and basic user interaction through console input and output.

The purpose of writing this software was to explore Java's syntax and features, particularly focusing on object-oriented principles and the use of collections. Through this project, I aimed to build a solid foundation in Java programming, which will support more complex future projects.
